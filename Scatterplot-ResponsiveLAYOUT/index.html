        <h1 > Data Visualization of Planets in the Solar System </h1>

    <div id="intro">
        <p>
        This is a little exploration of a data set that can be found on 
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jaredsavage/solar-system-major-bodies-data" target="_blank" style="color: #8ebf42">Kaggle</a>.
        The data is filtered to observations that are for planets in the solar system. Some values had to be adjusted as they were innacurate.
        <br>
        <br>
        The scatterplot maps the planets in relation to their density and and gravity.
